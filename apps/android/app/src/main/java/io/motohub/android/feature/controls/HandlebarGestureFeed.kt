 * arrives as a "next/previous track" command, i.e. wearing the label this app calls Left/Right
 * (road test 2026-07-29). Rather than hard-code one bike's quirks into the labels, the screen
 * lets the rider press a button and shows which slot answered: their own motorcycle explains
 * itself, whatever it is.
