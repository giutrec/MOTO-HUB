/**
 * Sees key presses from a Bluetooth HID-keyboard handlebar remote system-wide, regardless of
 * which app currently has focus on the TFT.
 *
 * Ordinary HID key events are delivered only to whatever window has focus — during a ride that
 * is normally Android Auto's own surface, not this app — so a plain `dispatchKeyEvent` in
 * [io.motohub.android.MainActivity] would never see them. Worse, a literal volume keycode
 * bypasses app focus entirely and goes straight to the system volume UI. An Accessibility
 * Service with [AccessibilityServiceInfo.FLAG_REQUEST_FILTER_KEY_EVENTS] is the one mechanism
 * short of root that can intercept either before that happens, which is why HID mode exists
 * as a whole: [MediaButtonBridge]'s normal path only ever sees keys the system already decided
 * to treat as AVRCP media-button events.
 *
 * Entirely inert unless BOTH are true: the rider granted this service in system Accessibility
 * settings (an explicit toggle Android requires; nothing in-app can flip it for them — see
 * [openAccessibilitySettings]) AND [HandlebarControlStore.inputMode] is currently
 * [HandlebarInputMode.HID]. In AVRCP mode, or with the service off, every key event is returned
 * unconsumed so it reaches whatever app would normally get it.
