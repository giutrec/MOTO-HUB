/**
 * Everything a diagnostics report needs that this edition cannot look up in its own process.
 *
 * The report itself is the same document in both editions - the same fields, the same collector,
 * the same consent gate. What differs is only where two of its inputs live:
 *
 *  - **the log.** ADVANCED runs the UI while CORE runs the transport, so a report from ADVANCED
 *    that carried only ADVANCED's own log would describe the half where nothing happens. It
 *    fetches CORE's over the bridge and staples the two together. CORE has the whole story in
 *    its own process and simply exports it.
 *  - **the wire ladder.** Walked and persisted in CORE. ADVANCED has to ask - and until it did,
 *    every report from every rider said "rung 0, no fingerprint", which is a true statement
 *    about ADVANCED's untouched copy of CORE's preferences and a false one about the motorcycle.
 *
 * Behind an interface rather than a `BuildConfig.IS_PRO` branch inside the builder because the
 * ADVANCED implementation reaches for the AIDL bridge, and the CORE flavour must not compile a
 * reference to a bridge it is the far end of.
 */
/**
 * Which halves hold BLUETOOTH_CONNECT, which is a per-package answer and therefore two answers.
 *
 * Null means "not this edition's to say" - CORE cannot see ADVANCED's grant at all, and ADVANCED
 * gets null for CORE when the bridge is unreachable or predates the call. Absent is not denied,
 * and the collector has to be able to tell them apart: a report that guessed would have sent
 * every CORE-only rider a warning about an app they do not have.
