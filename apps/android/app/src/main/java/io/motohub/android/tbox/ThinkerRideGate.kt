 * `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`/`BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` grant makes the LE scanner throw `SecurityException`
 * from deep inside a callback, which reads as a crash rather than the one screen tap that
 * actually fixes it.
 *
 * [requiresBle] is about ThinkerRide specifically, but [blePermissions] and [hasBlePermissions]
 * are the app's one answer for "may this process touch the LE radio" and [EcBtpTimeLink] uses
 * them too: its dash-clock write goes to an unbonded peripheral, which has to be scanned for.
