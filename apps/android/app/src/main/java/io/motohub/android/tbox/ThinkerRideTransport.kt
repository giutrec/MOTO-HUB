/**
 * ThinkerRide projection transport (KOVE-family dashboards). The roles are the inverse of
 * EasyConn: after [ThinkerRideBleLink] completes the BLE handshake, the *dash* connects to three
 * TCP servers the phone opens on the shared Wi-Fi network — control (17818), keep-alive (15457)
 * and video (15456). See [ThinkerRideProtocol] for the wire format and refs/KoveMirror for the
 * decoded reference implementation.
 *
 * The [TBoxTransport] lifecycle maps as: [discover] = bind the servers, pair over BLE and wait
 * for the dash's control connection (its "I can reach your phone" proof); [start] = tell the
 * dash over BLE to begin mirroring and wait for its video connection. The dash never reports a
 * panel size, so [start] emits the configured profile's geometry as the session's video area —
 * that is what makes other ThinkerRide models with other TFT resolutions a profile entry, not a
 * code change.
 *
 * A re-[discover] while the session is still healthy reuses it instead of tearing it down
 * (KoveMirror 9163284 keeps its TCP listeners alive across retries for the same reason): the
 * dash opens the video connection up to ~25s after mirror-start, and destroying the servers on
 * a retry leaves it mirroring into a socket nobody owns — a black TFT until power-cycle. The
 * video accept path is late-tolerant for the same scenario: a connection that arrives after
 * [start] gave up, or a dash that drops and reopens the channel, is wired straight into the
 * running session.
